  <summary><b>Git Basics</b></summary></br>
  
 I was already familiar with Git before and used some basic commands. But, week 1-2 of Coursera's [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) helped me understand more why Git (and VCS in general) is such a powerfull tool. I really enjoyed [Learning Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk). It helped me visualise what different git commands are doing. Learning in a game format is always fun :)

  <summary><b>Linux CLI, and HTTP</b></summary></br>
  
  Linux and HTTP were completelly new to me. [LinuzSurvival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/) was a geat introduction to the worls of Linux. I've learned a lot of new commands. Although, they can be easly forgotten without practice. HTTP readings were hard to understang at times and a bit boring. But I guess some basic understanding of what HTTP is can't hurt.

  <summary><b>VCS (hello gitty), GitHub and Collaboration</b></summary></br>
  
   Week 3-4 of Coursera's [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) and abvanced levels of [Learning Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk) helped me deepen my knowledge of Git. Now I have a pretty good idea of what remote repositories are and how to interact with them.
