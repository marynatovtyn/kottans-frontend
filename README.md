  <summary><b>Git Basics</b></summary></br>
  
 I was already familiar with Git before and used some basic commands. But, week 1-2 of Coursera's [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) helped me understand more why Git (and VCS in general) is such a powerfull tool. I really enjoyed [Learning Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk). It helped me visualise what different git commands are doing. Learning in a game format is always fun :)

  <summary><b>Linux CLI, and HTTP</b></summary></br>
  
  Linux and HTTP were completelly new to me. [LinuzSurvival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/) was a geat introduction to the worls of Linux. I've learned a lot of new commands. Although, they can be easly forgotten without practice. HTTP readings were hard to understang at times and a bit boring. But I guess some basic understanding of what HTTP is can't hurt.

  <summary><b>VCS (hello gitty), GitHub and Collaboration</b></summary></br>
  
   Week 3-4 of Coursera's [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) and abvanced levels of [Learning Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk) helped me deepen my knowledge of Git. Now I have a pretty good idea of what remote repositories are and how to interact with them.

  <summary><b>Intro to HTML & CSS</b></summary></br>
  
 Most of material from [Coursera's 1-2weeks ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/week/2), Codecademy's [Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) and [Learn CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) was not new to me as I studied HTML and CSS before. Nonetheless, courses were interesting and it was good to go through the topics again to refresh them in my memory.

  <summary><b>Responsive Web Design</b></summary></br>

[Responsive web design basics](https://web.dev/i18n/en/responsive-web-design-basics/) was a good intro piece to responsive design. I was already familiar with Flexbox and Grid, but viveo courses definitylly helped me better understand these concepts. I will definitelly use flexbox and grid in the future as they a such a great tools that make building responsive desing so much easier.
As always games - [FlexboxFroggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/#ru) - were so much fun!

  <summary><b>JavaScript Basics</b></summary></br>

[JS basics course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/week/4) was a good intro piece to JavaScript.
I really liked [FreeCodeCamp course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript). Especially parts on Fucntional programming and Algorithm Scripting were challenging. As it was a completelly new material for me.
